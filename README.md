Ground
======

Ground is a series of programming exercises where the tools provided by
the language you are allowed to use are limited in the description.

Why
---

Sometimes it's hard to understand the value or identify the problems a
given tool/method solves if you have that tool introduced to you without
encountering the problem first. This is applicable to almost any
language, tool or method but I will focus on special functions like
`map`, `reduce` and `filter` and how they are useful when programming.
Hopefully this will serve as a crutch to teaching
[higher-order functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html),
amongst other things.

How
---

Each problem will have its own folder, inside `problems/`. Each problem
will contain its set of tests which can help the student verify their
assertions.

The problems don't have a specific order, as each problem should define
the constructs the student can use in each step of the problem.
